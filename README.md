[playhvz.org](https://playhvz.org) Launching March 2023
***

This is a website dedicated to managing Humans Vs Zombies games. Originally created by the computer science department of UNCC's Charlotte Outdoor Gaming club, this project supports both a standalone website and optional discord integration. 

Supported features:
* Organiazations
    * User created orgs can create and host games.
    * Orgs have administrators and moderators to manage users throughout the game.

* Games
    * Games may be started, paused, and stopped by org admins.
    * Users will have an unique ID randomly generated for them.
    * Users joining will be set to human or zombie based on the game settings.
    * OZ support
        * Users can decide if they want to be an OZ, and when the game starts a few of these users will be selected and notified. The amount of users is configurable, and can be entirely disabled by org admins.
        * OZ tags do not show who the OZ is.
        * The OZ can choose to be a zombie or human after getting a set number of tags.


Coming soon:
* Discord integration
